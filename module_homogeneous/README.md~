This code produces the first part of results of the paper Guseva &
Feudel (2022), "Motility pattern and shape of bacteria improve their
ability to track moving nutrient source in a flow filed."

It is written in Python, with additional functions imported from C++
using Boost.Python. To run the code make sure to have installed Python
3.10 and Boost.Python.

# File list:
--------

1. **randomflow_mod.py**: Models a random flow field. For a detailed
description of the implementation of the random flow field and its
propertis please see H. Sigurgeirsson and A. M. Stuart, Physics of
Fluids 14, 4352 (2002) or J. García-Ojalvo, J. M. Sancho, and
L. Ramírez-Piscina, Physical Review A 46, 4670 (1992).

2. **swimmers_mod.py**: Implements swimmer motility. Swimmers are
advected and rotated by the flow field, while moving with a certain
constant speed. They are also able to randomly switching direction
after certain periods of time. 

3. **fluid.cc**: functions written in C++, to improve the computation
time.

# Code details

# Run files:
--------

The files generate the data of the Fig.3 of Guseva & Feudel (2022).
Create a file directory "data".

1. **FD_range.py**: Generates the datapoins for Fig.3 (a).
Run using three parameters as input:

    pyhton ./FD_range.py us tau alpha type

where:
	us  -- velocity of the bacteria relative ot the flow velocity (set to 0.5)
	tau -- runnin time of bacteria between direction changes
	alpha -- shape of the bacateria (set to 0.98 in the figure)
       	type -- type of motility pattern (can be "NN" -- simple swimmers,
       	     	"RT" -- swimmers doing run and tumble, "RR" -- swimmers with run
	       	reverse motility)

other parameters set to:
      number of swimeers  -- 10000  (N_bac, line 33)
      grid size  -- 250
      dt -- 0.01 s

the output is set at every 5 s (new file is created). To change output filename
see line 63.
      	       	   
2. **align.py**: Generates the datapoins for Fig.3 (b, c, d).
Run using four parameters as input:
    	  pyhton ./align_us.py us tau alpha type
	 
for the definition of parameters see item 1.

other parameters set to:
        number of swimeers  -- 1000  (N_bac)
      	grid size  -- 250
	transient time set to -- 1 min (60 s)          (TO DO !!!!!!!!!)
	output time -- every 10 s
